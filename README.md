# Practical Deep Learning for Coders (fast.ai courses)

These is my copy of the lecture materials from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/). 

Keras 1.2 was used during this course but there have been many updates since. I will modify the existing material to use Keras 2 here.
